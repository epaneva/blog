introduction
- describe use cases
  + mention personalized medicine
  + messages to people to prevent them from leaving service
  + main focus: politics (persuasion/gotv ads, canvassing, donation requests)
- describe general case: figure out what will get us best lift
  + describe randomized experiment
  + define lift
- ask question we will answer: how do we do this?

alternative strategies
- find out who is neutral on an issue and target them for persuasion
- find passions (valence + importance) and target for gotv or donation
- classify people into k groups and focus on what makes them unique
- call these "message-tailored approaches"
- issue is that they don't optimize on what we are interested in
- discuss what it is that they optimize on, in turn
- say that we can directly optimize on what we are interested in...

htes
- what we want to do is optimize on a causal effect of the treatment
- what is causality?
  + rubin causal model
  + potential outcomes
  + can't observe counterfactual, so just find similar people
- idea of htes is to find similar people in both conditions and compare them
- this is an estimate of the causal effect, given randomization
  + not sure if want to get into strong ignorability
- how do we define "similar people"? many algorithms to do this
- area is called heterogenous treatment effects
  + aka interaction detection, optimal treatment regimes, uplift modeling...
  + ...personalized medicine, subgroup identification, ...
  + ...all in a bourgeoning area of causal (machine) learning
  + R packages: FindIt, personalized, uplift, bart, beanz, krls, ensembles
- will focus on causal forests in the generalized regression forest framework

causal forest
- bagging done on honest causal trees
- explain how causal trees trained
- show splitting criterion rewards variation in treatment effects

example, code, comparison
- describe the trans study and data
- explain what we will do
- show code on how to fit and predict
- show 3 different ways to compare problem
- show wrapper function for plotting htes to see if heterogeneity exists
- show lalonde data where it is more obvious that it exists

conclusion
-
