It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in

No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing

I'm a monster, I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong
I'm a problem
That'll never ever be solved

And no matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing

I'm a monster, I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave in, never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of

No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing

So amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing
