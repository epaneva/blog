Turn my headphones up, louder

LOLOLOLO white America, assassinate my character
Money matrimony, yeah they tryna break the marriage up
Who gon' act phony, or who gone try to embarrass ya
I'mma need a day off, I think I'll call Ferris up
Had a conference with the DJs, Puerto Rico three days
Sorry I’m in pajamas but I just got off the PJ
And last party we had, they shut down Prive
Yep!
Ain’t that like Lebron James?

Racks on racks on racks
Maybachs on bachs on bachs on bachs on bachs
Oh shit, it’s just blacks on blacks on blacks
Hundred stack Nigga layin’ raps on tracks
Made a left on Nostrand Ave., we in Bed Stuy
I remain Chi-town
