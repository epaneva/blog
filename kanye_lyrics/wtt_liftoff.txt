Lift off, lift off, takin' my coat off
Showing my tattoos, I'm such a show off, huh
I feel the pain and then roll off
I got the whole city, they about to go off
How many niggas with me up and in the aisle?
How many people want to roll on me now?
Like you know na na na, you know me by now
Know me, know me by now

Lift off, like you know na na na
You know me by now, know me, know me by now
You know me know me by now, know me, know me by now
