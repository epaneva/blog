Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?
Huh, I gave you my loyalty
Took care of these niggas' lawyer fees

A nigga gotta watch the throne
Gotta separate from these fuckin fakes
Only if that nigga don’t creep up
I’ve never been a deep sleeper

Cause the nigga that said he’ll
is now
These niggas got a shot they’ll shoot
forgive him not know
