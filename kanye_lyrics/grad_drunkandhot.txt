We go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
She go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls

Driving around town looking for the best spot
For the drunk and hot girls
Up in the club look at here what we got
Some drunk and hot girls
Stop dancing with your girlfriend and come dance with me
Stop talking 'bout your boyfriend since he is not me
Stop running up my tab cause these drinks is not free
You drunk and hot girl

Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
She go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls

I don't want to drop your friends off, I just want you
You drunk and hot girl
You want to sit down but we hit the drive-thru
You drunk and hot girl
Please don't fall asleep, baby, we almost back
Please don't throw up in the car, we almost crashed
Oh, now you sober, how'd I know you'd say that
You drunk and hot girl

We go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
She go through too much bullshit

Don't tell me, you sing, you about to get a deal
You drunk and hot girl

You drunk and hot girl, yeah

I thought I'd be with you for only one night
