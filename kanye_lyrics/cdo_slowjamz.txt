It definitely will
You know what I told her
I told her to drive over in yo new whip, bring some friends you cool wit
I'mma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbin me, callin me Biggie like Shyne home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lyin though?
Tellin me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready For The World, she was ready for some action
My dog said you ain't no freak , so you bout to prove my man wrong
I'mma play this Vandross, you gon' take yo pants off
I'mma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon get right

Damn baby, I can't do it that fast but I know somebody who can, Twista!
